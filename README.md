# C-
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is used to take a list of items purchased to calculate the frequency of each item and display that frequency to the end user.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I hit all points with taking the items from the list and calculating each items occurence within the file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think my code is effiecent, loops well, and hits all points specified.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Going back over my previous work i was able too figure out the nestred for loop needed for the histogram aspect. Zybooks is my most useful tool.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The most useful tool will be succefully reading from files and manipulating them.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This code is maintanable, readable, and adaptable because i used simple practices with clear notes that make the reader very in tuned with what is being done.
